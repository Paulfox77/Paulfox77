- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paulfox77
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Responsive Web Design, CSS3 HTML5 and Bootstrap is my main focus right now, plus additionally all the necessary resources, Domains, Hosting, some PHP and JavaScript.  Author Daniel Walter Scott on Udemy. I like the Easy Tutorials channel on youtube, Great inspiration for me. I also use freecodecamp, partake in Alison online courses, on Comp TIA and many more i'd like to continue working on. 
-  @media queries & pixel density.
-  One to mention, I have studied in an Irish college, C# .Net Object Oriented Programming, I was also pulling SQL requests in Management Studio and I have built and worked on Oracle virtual box Machines including swap files and partitions, all using Redhat software..  This backend experience, 'I am confident' will appeal to employers and show some of my alternative capabilities to my Front End experience. They all go well together pointing me towards a bright future as a Full Stack developer. :)

I am in the process of making my Portfolio and will update it regularly.
