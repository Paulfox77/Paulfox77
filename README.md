- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paulfox77
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Responsive Web Design, CSS3 HTML5 and Bootstrap is my main focus right now, plus additionally all the necessary resources, Domains, Hosting, some PHP and JavaScript. 
-  @media queries & pixel density.
-  One to mention, I have studied in an Irish college, C# .net OBject Oriented Programming, I was also pulling SQL requests in Management Studio and I have built and worked on Oracle virtual box Machines, using Redhat..  This backend experience, 'I am confident' will appeal to employers and show my alternative capabilities to Front end. They all go well together pointing me towards a bright future as a Full Stack developer.. 

I am in the process of making my Portfolio and will update it suitably regularly. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
